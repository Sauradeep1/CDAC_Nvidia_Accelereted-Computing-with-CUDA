By the time you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Use the Nsight Systems command line tool (**nsys**) to profile accelerated application performance.
- Leverage an understanding of **Streaming Multiprocessors** to optimize execution configurations.
- Understand the behavior of **Unified Memory** with regard to page faulting and data migrations.
- Use **asynchronous memory prefetching** to reduce page faults and data migrations for increased performance.
- Employ an iterative development cycle to rapidly accelerate and deploy applications.
