## Objectives

By the time you complete this lab you will be able to:

- Use **Nsight Systems** to visually profile the timeline of GPU-accelerated CUDA applications.
- Use Nsight Systems to identify, and exploit, optimization opportunities in GPU-accelerated CUDA applications.
- Utilize CUDA streams for concurrent kernel execution in accelerated applications.
- (**Optional Advanced Content**) Use manual device memory allocation, including allocating pinned memory, in order to asynchronously transfer data in concurrent CUDA streams.
