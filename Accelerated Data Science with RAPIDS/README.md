In cases where datasets are large and computational times need to be minimised, NVIDIA’s RAPIDS offers an efficient way to enhance the speed of data science procedures. In this guide, we will be diving deep into what is NVIDIA’s RAPIDS and how RAPIDS libraries help increase the rate of various data science processes to quite an impressive level.

Introduction on RAPIDS
How often has it happened that you had to wait for hours staring blankly at your screen, waiting for your ML Model to get trained? Quite often, I guess. Like Data Science enthusiasts, we all have found ourselves prolonged model training processes. When it comes to Data Science and Machine Learning, python provides an abundance of libraries that make model building and training a relatively simple deal. With these in-built functions available at hand, speed boils down to the efficiency of data science workflows.
In cases where datasets are large and computational times need to be minimised, NVIDIA’s RAPIDS offers an efficient way to enhance the speed of data science procedures. In this guide, we will be diving deep into what is NVIDIA’s RAPIDS and how RAPIDS libraries help increase the rate of various data science processes to quite an impressive level.
The betterment in the speed of operations in RAPIDS is due to GPU acceleration. While Python libraries run on CPU, RAPIDS libraries run on GPUs.

What is RAPIDS?
RAPIDS is a suite of open-source software that runs on GPUs and allows users to run end-to-end data science pipelines at high speed.
Now, one may get deterred by the thought that one needs to get accustomed to the syntax of new libraries in trade for increased speed. But worry not! NVIDIA has been kind enough to take care of it. Most of the RAPIDS libraries mirror the APIs/functions of the Python libraries, making the shift from Python modules to GPU-backed RAPIDS relatively smooth.
